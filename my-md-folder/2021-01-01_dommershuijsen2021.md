abstract = "The COVID-19 pandemic has introduced a myriad of challenges to the social life and care of people with Parkinson's disease (PD), which could potentially worsen mental health problems. We used baseline data of the PRIME-NL study (N\\,=\\,844) to examine whether the association between COVID-19 stressors and mental health is disproportionately large in specific subgroups of people with PD and to explore effects of hypothetical reductions in COVID-19 stressors on mental health and quality of life. The mean (SD) age of the study population was 70.3 (7.8) years and 321 (38.0\\%) were women. The linear regression effect estimate of the association of COVID-19 stressors with mental health was most pronounced in women, highly educated people, people with advanced PD and people prone to distancing or seeking social support. Smaller effect estimates were found in people scoring high on confrontive coping or planful problem solving. The parametric G-formula method was used to calculate the effects of hypothetical interventions on COVID-19 stressors. An intervention reducing stressors with 50\\% in people with above median MDS-UPDRS-II decreased the Beck Depression Inventory in this group from 14.7 to 10.6, the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory from 81.6 to 73.1 and the Parkinson's Disease Quality of Life Questionnaire from 35.0 to 24.3. Insights from this cross-sectional study help to inform tailored care interventions to subgroups of people with PD most vulnerable to the impact of COVID-19 on mental health and quality of life."
