A latent class Bayesian hierarchical regression model was employed to account for the imperfect sensitivity and specificity of billing and hospitalization data in case ascertainment. We accounted for demographic factors, estimating prevalence rates for the First Nations and non-First Nations populations by sex, age group, and location of residence (urban/rural).\textbackslash n\textbackslash nRESULTS: Our model estimated the prevalence of SLE in Alberta to be 27.3 cases per 10,000 females (95\% credible interval [95\% CrI] 25.9-28.8) and 3.2 cases per 10,000 males (95\% CrI 2.6-3.8). The overall prevalence of SSc in Alberta was 5.8 cases per 10,000 females (95\% CrI 5.1-6.5) and 1.0 case per 10,000 males (95\% CrI 0.7-1.4). First Nations females over 45 years of age had twice the prevalence of either SLE or SSc relative to non-First Nations females. There was also a trend toward higher overall SLE prevalence in urban dwellers, and higher overall SSc prevalence in rural residents.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nCONCLUSION: First Nations females older than 45 years of age have an increased prevalence of either SLE or SSc. This may reflect a true predominance of autoimmune rheumatic diseases in this demographic, or may indicate systematic differences in health care delivery.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To present preliminary data on incidence of malignancy in juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA), compared to general population rates. METHODS: We examined cancer occurrence within JIA registries at 3 Canadian pediatric rheumatology centers. The subjects in the clinic registries were linked to regional tumor registries to determine the occurrence of invasive cancers over the observation period (spanning 1974-2006). The total number of cancers expected was determined by multiplying the person-years in the cohort by age, sex, and calendar year-specific cancer rates. The standardized incidence ratio (SIR, ratio of cancers observed to expected) was generated, with 95\% confidence intervals. RESULTS: The study sample consisted of 1834 patients. The female proportion was 67.6\%; average age at entry to cohort was 8.6 years (SD 5.1). The majority were Caucasian. Subjects contributed 22,341 patient-years (average 12.2, SD 7.8). Within this observation period, one invasive cancer occurred, compared to 7.9 expected (SIR 0.12, 95\% CI 0.0, 0.70). This was a hematological cancer (Hodgkin's lymphoma), representing a SIR for hematological malignancies of 0.76 (95\% CI 0.02, 4.21). CONCLUSION: Only one invasive cancer was identified in this large sample of individuals with JIA, observed for an average of 12.2 years each. These data suggest that, at least in the initial years following diagnosis of JIA, the  risk of invasive cancers overall is not markedly increased. The results do not rule out the possibility of a baseline increased risk of hematological malignancies.},

Subjects were linked to cancer registries for the observational interval, spanning 1974 to 2009. The ratio of observed to expected cancers represents the standardized incidence ratio (SIR) or relative cancer risk in childhood-onset SLE, versus the general population.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nRESULTS: There were 1020 patients aged {$<$}18 at cohort entry. Most (82\%) were female and Caucasian; mean age at cohort entry was 12.6 years (standard deviation (SD)\,=\,3.6). Subjects were observed for a total of 7,986 (average 7.8) patient-years. Within this interval, only three invasive cancers were expected. However, 14 invasive cancers occurred with an SIR of 4.7, 95\% confidence interval (CI) 2.6 to 7.8. Three hematologic cancers were found (two non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, one leukemia), for an SIR of 5.2 (95\% CI 1.1 to 15.2). The SIRs stratified by age group and sex, were similar across these strata. There was a trend for highest cancer occurrence 10 to 19 years after SLE diagnosis.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nCONCLUSIONS: These results suggest an increased cancer risk in pediatric onset SLE versus the general population. In absolute terms, this represents relatively few events. Of note, risk may be highest only after patients have transferred to adult care.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Administrative data are increasingly being used for research and surveillance about rheumatic diseases. However, literature reviews have revealed a lack of consistency in methods for conducting observational rheumatic disease studies, a situation that can lead to findings that cannot be compared. Our purpose was to develop best-practice consensus statements about the use of administrative data for rheumatic disease research and surveillance in Canada.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nMETHODS: We convened 52 decision makers, epidemiologists, clinicians, and researchers to a 2-day workshop. Prior to this, participants formed working groups to examine 3 best-practice categories: case definitions, epidemiology methods, and comorbidity and outcomes measurement. The groups conducted systematic or scoping reviews on key topics. At the workshop, evidence from the reviews was presented and consensus-building techniques were used to develop the best-practice statements. The statements were presented, discussed, revised (as needed), and then subjected to voting.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nRESULTS: Thirteen best-practice consensus statements were developed and endorsed by consensus. For the first category, these consensus statements addressed validation techniques for rheumatic disease case definitions and case ascertainment bias. The consensus statements for epidemiology methods focused on confounding and drug exposure measurement. For comorbidity and outcomes measurement, consensus statements were developed for multiple conditions, including osteoporosis and fragility fractures, cancer, infections, cardiovascular disease, and renal disease. Strengths and limitations of administrative data were identified in relation to each topic.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nCONCLUSION: Our best-practice consensus statements are consistent with other recent guidelines, including those for rheumatic disease biologics registries, but address additional issues specific to administrative data. Continuing work focuses on disseminating these consensus statements to multiple audiences.},

  abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic has introduced a myriad of challenges to the social life and care of people with Parkinson's disease (PD), which could potentially worsen mental health problems. We used baseline data of the PRIME-NL study (N\,=\,844) to examine whether the association between COVID-19 stressors and mental health is disproportionately large in specific subgroups of people with PD and to explore effects of hypothetical reductions in COVID-19 stressors on mental health and quality of life. The mean (SD) age of the study population was 70.3 (7.8) years and 321 (38.0\%) were women. The linear regression effect estimate of the association of COVID-19 stressors with mental health was most pronounced in women, highly educated people, people with advanced PD and people prone to distancing or seeking social support. Smaller effect estimates were found in people scoring high on confrontive coping or planful problem solving. The parametric G-formula method was used to calculate the effects of hypothetical interventions on COVID-19 stressors. An intervention reducing stressors with 50\% in people with above median MDS-UPDRS-II decreased the Beck Depression Inventory in this group from 14.7 to 10.6, the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory from 81.6 to 73.1 and the Parkinson's Disease Quality of Life Questionnaire from 35.0 to 24.3.

  abstract = {Abstract             Case-control studies are an important part of the epidemiologic literature, yet there remains a lot of confusion about how to interpret estimates from different case-control study designs. We demonstrate that not all case-control study designs estimate odds ratios. In contrast, case-control studies in the literature often report odds ratios as their main parameter even when using designs that do not estimate odds ratios. Therefore, only studies using specific case-control designs should report odds ratios, whereas the case-cohort and incidence density sampled case-control studies must report risk ratio and incidence rate ratios, respectively. This also applies to case-control studies conducted in open cohorts which often estimate incidence rate ratios. We also demonstrate the misinterpretation of case-control study estimates in a small sample of highly-cited case-control studies in general epidemiologic and medical journals. We therefore suggest greater care be taken when considering which parameter is to be reported from a case-control study.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT OBJECTIVE To describe the focalization and coverage of Bolsa Fam\'ilia Program among the families of children who are part of the 2004 Pelotas birth cohort (2004 cohort). METHODS The data used derives from the integration of information from the 2004 cohort and the Cadastro \'Unico para Programas Sociais do Governo Federal (Cad\'Unico \textendash{} Register for Social Programs of the Federal Government), in the 2004-2010 period. We estimated the program coverage (percentage of eligible people who receive the benefit) and its focus (proportion of eligible people among the beneficiaries). We used two criteria to define eligibility: the per capita household income reported in the cohort follow-ups and belonging to the 20\% poorest families according to the National Economic Indicator (IEN), an asset index. RESULTS Between 2004 and 2010, the proportion of families in the cohort that received the benefit increased from 11\% to 34\%. We observed an increase in all wealth quintiles. In 2010, by income and wealth quintiles (IEN), 62\%-72\% of the families were beneficiaries among the 20\% poorest people, 2\%-5\% among the 20\% richest people, and about 30\% of families of the intermediate quintile. According to household income (minus the benefit) 29\% of families were eligible in 2004 and 16\% in 2010. By the same criteria, the coverage of the program increased from 43\% in 2004 to 71\% in 2010. In the same period, by the wealth criterion (IEN), coverage increased from 29\% to 63\%. The focalization of the program decreased from 78\% in 2004 to 32\% in 2010 according to income, and remained constant (37\%) according to the IEN. CONCLUSIONS Among the families of the 2004 cohort, there was a significant increase in the program coverage, from its inception until 2010, when it was near 70\%. The focus of the program was below 40\% in 2010, indicating that more than half of the beneficiaries did not belong to the target population.},

  abstract = {Objective There is a decreased breast cancer risk in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) versus the general population. We assessed a large sample of SLE patients, evaluating demographic and clinical characteristics and breast cancer risk. Methods We performed case-cohort analyses within a multi-center international SLE sample. We calculated the breast cancer hazard ratio (HR) in female SLE patients, relative to demographics, reproductive history, family history of breast cancer, and time-dependent measures of anti-dsDNA positivity, cumulative disease activity, and drugs, adjusted for SLE duration. Results There were 86 SLE breast cancers and 4498 female SLE cancer-free controls. Patients were followed on average for 7.6 years. Versus controls, SLE breast cancer cases tended to be white and older. Breast cancer cases were similar to controls regarding anti-dsDNA positivity, disease activity, and most drug exposures over time. In univariate and multivariate models, the principal factor associated with breast cancers was older age at cohort entry. Conclusions There was little evidence that breast cancer risk in this SLE sample was strongly driven by any of the clinical factors that we studied. Further search for factors that determine the lower risk of breast cancer in SLE may be warranted.},

METHODS: The authors identified women with SLE using Quebec administrative databases (1 January 1994 to 31 December 2003). The authors determined the number of live births, and calculated the standardised incidence ratio (SIR) of observed to expected live births. RESULTS: 1334 women with SLE were identified. Overall, the number of live births over the interval (559) was below that which would be expected (708) (SIR 0.79; 95\% CI 0.73 to 0.86). Compared with the general population, live births were substantially lower after SLE diagnosis (SIR 0.62; 95\% CI 0.55 to 0.70) than before diagnosis (SIR 1.01; 95\% CI 0.90 to 1.13). CONCLUSION: After diagnosis, women with SLE have substantially fewer live births than the general population.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the quality of the methods and reporting of published studies that validate administrative database algorithms for rheumatic disease case ascertainment. METHODS: We systematically searched MEDLINE, Embase, and the reference lists of articles published from 1980 to 2011. We included studies that validated administrative data algorithms for rheumatic disease case ascertainment using medical record or patient-reported diagnoses as the reference standard. Each study was evaluated using published standards for the reporting and quality assessment of diagnostic accuracy, which informed the development of a methodologic framework to help critically appraise and guide research in this area. RESULTS: Twenty-three studies met the inclusion criteria. Administrative database algorithms to identify cases were most frequently validated against diagnoses in medical records (83\%). Almost two-thirds of the studies (61\%) used diagnosis codes in administrative data to identify potential cases and then reviewed medical records to confirm the diagnoses. The remaining studies did the reverse, identifying patients using a reference standard and then testing algorithms to identify cases in administrative data. Many authors (61\%) described the patient population, but few (26\%) reported key measures of diagnostic accuracy (sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values). Only one-third of studies reported disease prevalence in the validation study sample. CONCLUSION: The methods used in administrative data validation studies of rheumatic diseases are highly variable. Few studies reported key measures of diagnostic accuracy despite their importance for drawing conclusions about the validity of administrative database algorithms. We developed a methodologic framework and recommendations for validation study conduct and reporting.},

  abstract = {Objective: To determine cancer incidence in a large clinical juvenile-onset arthritis population. Methods: We combined data from 6 existing North American juvenile-onset arthritis cohorts. Patients with juvenile-onset arthritis were linked to regional cancer registries to detect incident cancers after cohort entry, defined as first date seen in the paediatric rheumatology clinic. The expected number of malignancies was obtained by multiplying the person- years observed (defined from cohort entry to end of follow-up) by the geographically matched age, sex and calendar year-specific cancer rates. The standardised incidence ratios (SIR; ratio of cancers observed to expected) were generated, with 95\% CIs. Results: The 6 juvenile arthritis registries provided a total of 5294 patients. The mean age at cohort entry was 8.9 (SD 5.0) years and 68\% of participants were female. The mean duration of follow-up was 6.8 years with a total of 36 063 person-years spanning 1978\textendash{} 2012. During follow-up, 9 invasive cancers occurred, compared with 10.9 expected (SIR 0.82, 95\% CI 0.38 to 1.5). 3 of these were haematological (Hodgkin's, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and leukaemia). 6 of the patients with cancer were exposed to disease- modifying drugs; 5 of these had also been exposed to biological agents. Conclusions: We did not clearly demonstrate an increase in overall malignancy risk in patients with juvenile-onset arthritis followed for an average of almost 7 years. 3 of the 9 observed cancers were haematological. 5 of the cancers arose in children exposed to biological agents. Longer follow-up of this population is warranted, with further study of drug effects. What is already known about this subject? {$\blacktriangleright$} In many systemic autoimmune rheumatic dis- eases, including rheumatoid arthritis, there is an increased risk (compared to the general popula- tion) of certain malignancies. What does this study add? {$\blacktriangleright$} This study provides a multi-centre perspective of the issue of cancer risk in juvenile arthritis, in clinic-based settings. How might this impact on clinical practice? {$\blacktriangleright$} In juvenile-onset arthritis, cancer was a relatively rare event, which is reassuring for patients and physicians. However, the possibility of an increased risk of hematological malignancies in juvenile-onset arthritis remains a concern. This and the effects of drug exposures, should be the focus of future studies.},
