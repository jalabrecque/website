  abstract = {Little is known about how rheumatoid arthritis (RA) affects an{\textbackslash}nindividual's ability to relocate. The current literature suggests the{\textbackslash}nrelationship between health and migration is often disease-specific. We{\textbackslash}nsought to estimate the impact of RA diagnosis on migration within a{\textbackslash}nCanadian province, comparing migration rates in residents before and{\textbackslash}nafter RA diagnosis. We identified a cohort of 81,181 individuals{\textbackslash}ndiagnosed with RA between 1998 and 2009 using Quebec administrative{\textbackslash}ndatabases. A migration was defined as a change in the first three{\textbackslash}ncharacters of the postal code. We categorized migrations as urban or{\textbackslash}nrural depending upon an individual's origin and destination. We{\textbackslash}nestimated the association between RA diagnosis and migration by fitting{\textbackslash}nmarginal models using a generalized estimating equations approach,{\textbackslash}nadjusting for age, sex, and population level socioeconomic status{\textbackslash}nindicators. The vast majority of moves after RA diagnosis were within{\textbackslash}nurban areas. RA diagnosis was associated with increased migration except{\textbackslash}nfor people around age 50 moving within urban areas. Although RA was{\textbackslash}nassociated with increased inter-urban migration in many demographic{\textbackslash}ngroups, the net result did not translate to higher rates of{\textbackslash}nrural-to-urban migration after RA diagnosis. Our results suggest fairly{\textbackslash}ncomplex associations between RA diagnosis and migration. Both age and{\textbackslash}nlocation (urban or rural) modify this effect. Overall, we did not see a{\textbackslash}ngreater movement from rural-to-urban areas after RA diagnosis. This is{\textbackslash}nof interest for studies of regional environmental effects on chronic{\textbackslash}ndisease patterns.},
