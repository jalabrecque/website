  abstract = {ABSTRACT OBJECTIVE To describe the focalization and coverage of Bolsa Fam{\'i}lia Program among the families of children who are part of the 2004 Pelotas birth cohort (2004 cohort). METHODS The data used derives from the integration of information from the 2004 cohort and the Cadastro {\'U}nico para Programas Sociais do Governo Federal (Cad{\'U}nico {\textendash} Register for Social Programs of the Federal Government), in the 2004-2010 period. We estimated the program coverage (percentage of eligible people who receive the benefit) and its focus (proportion of eligible people among the beneficiaries). We used two criteria to define eligibility: the per capita household income reported in the cohort follow-ups and belonging to the 20\% poorest families according to the National Economic Indicator (IEN), an asset index. RESULTS Between 2004 and 2010, the proportion of families in the cohort that received the benefit increased from 11\% to 34\%. We observed an increase in all wealth quintiles. In 2010, by income and wealth quintiles (IEN), 62\%-72\% of the families were beneficiaries among the 20\% poorest people, 2\%-5\% among the 20\% richest people, and about 30\% of families of the intermediate quintile. According to household income (minus the benefit) 29\% of families were eligible in 2004 and 16\% in 2010. By the same criteria, the coverage of the program increased from 43\% in 2004 to 71\% in 2010. In the same period, by the wealth criterion (IEN), coverage increased from 29\% to 63\%. The focalization of the program decreased from 78\% in 2004 to 32\% in 2010 according to income, and remained constant (37\%) according to the IEN. CONCLUSIONS Among the families of the 2004 cohort, there was a significant increase in the program coverage, from its inception until 2010, when it was near 70\%. The focus of the program was below 40\% in 2010, indicating that more than half of the beneficiaries did not belong to the target population.},
