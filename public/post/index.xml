      <title>Why do we even bother with conditional estimators anymore?</title>
      <link>/post/marginal-vs-conditional/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A recent paper by Shrier et al was recently sent to me: &lt;a href=&#34;https://ebm.bmj.com/content/early/2019/08/22/bmjebm-2019-111225.abstract&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Challenges in interpreting results from ‘multiple regression’ when there is interaction between covariates&lt;/a&gt;. If you&amp;rsquo;re not familiar with conditional versus marginal estimates it&amp;rsquo;s a nice review of this concept and even includes a formula in the appendix allowing you to calculate the difference between the conditional and marginal estimates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bottomline: when the effect of an exposure or treatment differs across a covariate, conditional estimates (e.g. the coefficient from multiple regression) from models that do no include the interaction between treatment and those covariates will not estimate the population average treatment effect. This means, to correctly estimate the population average treatment effect you have to correctly specify all interactions with treatment in your model (and average over covariates). We already know that measuring and adjusting for all confounders is an impossible goal and now we&amp;rsquo;re being asked to specify all interactions?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Shrier et al point out, inverse probability of treatment weighting will estimate the population average treatment effect without having to specify treatment-covariate interactions. So why do we even bother with conditional estimators? Well, the difference is unlikely to be very large so maybe it&amp;rsquo;s not worth the bother. Ok, maybe the difference isn&amp;rsquo;t very large but there are other reasons to not use conditional estimators.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, you&amp;rsquo;re not a slave to your link function. With binary outcomes, people tend to report odds ratios because that&amp;rsquo;s what the exponentiated coefficients gives you. Estimating risk differences or risk ratios is possible but a hassle because of convergence issues, etc. But with inverse probability of treatment weighting (and other methods that estimate marginal effects like g-computation and targeted maximum likelihood estimation), it&amp;rsquo;s easy to choose the parameter you want.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, inverse probability of treatment weighting easily lets you check balance in your confounders and whether positivity is satisfied. This is something that should be default behaviour for causal inference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And last, inverse probability of treatment weighting and other marginal methods like g-computation and targeted maximum likelihood estimation can easily be compared to each other as a modeling check because, if they disagree, you know &lt;em&gt;at least&lt;/em&gt; one model is wrong (note &lt;em&gt;at least&lt;/em&gt;, most likely all are wrong) and you can go back and recheck your models.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, really, why do we even bother with conditional estimators anymore?&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Keeping sets of instrumental variable assumptions straight</title>
      <link>/post/iv-assumptions/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 02 Aug 2019 21:13:14 -0500</pubDate>
      <guid>/post/iv-assumptions/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I read a lot of instrumental variable (IV) papers and most include a description of the IV assumptions. Given that IV analyses are popular in different fields, it isn&amp;rsquo;t surprising that there is a lot of variability in how they are stated. There is more than one way they can be stated accurately. But sometimes it&amp;rsquo;s clear there has been some confusion. Below is a causal graph I often encounter in the epidemiology literature:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;unnamed-chunk-1-1.png&#34; style=&#34;display: block; margin: auto;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes the arrow from $IV$ to $C$ goes in other direction or I&amp;rsquo;ve even seen it bidirectional.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It not easy to depict visually the IV assumptions because it involves trying to show the absence of arrows, i.e. the grey arrows above. But this one gets it wrong in a couple different ways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First the arrow from $IV$ to $C$ is showing another exclusion restriction violation where the exclusion restriction is the assumption that the instrument $IV$ does not affect the outcome $Y$ except through treatment $A$. Both the direct arrow from $IV$ to $Y$ and from $IV$ to $C$ show exclusion restriction violations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you reverse the $IV$-$C$ arrow, it&amp;rsquo;s not longer an exclusion restriction violation but shows a violation of indepence&amp;ndash;the assumption that the instrument $IV$ does not share any causes with the outcome $Y$. But this isn&amp;rsquo;t a complete picture of the independence assumption because it only says that exposure-outcome confounders can be related to $IV$. The variable $B$ below violates independence in a way that would not be capture in the causal graph above:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;unnamed-chunk-2-1.png&#34; style=&#34;display: block; margin: auto;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The confusion, I think, is that some versions of the IV assumptions make reference to the exposure-outcome confounders:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(1a) The instrument is associated with the exposure
  (1b) The instrument is independent of the outcome given the exposure and all confounders (measured and unmeasured) of the exposure–outcome association (i.e., the exclusion restriction)
  (1c) The instrument is independent of factors (measured and unmeasured) that confound the exposure–outcome relationship&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While others don&amp;rsquo;t:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(2a) The instrument is associated with the exposure
  (2b) The instrument the instrument $IV$ does not affect the outcome $Y$ except through treatment $A$ (exclusion restriction)
  (2c) The instrument $IV$ does not share any causes with the outcome $Y$&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both sets are valid descriptions of the IV assumptions but, to me, the first set has two drawbacks. First, it makes mention of the exposure-outcome confounders. We use IV analyses because we believe that we can&amp;rsquo;t identify all unmeasured confounders so why include them in our definition of an IV? Including a set of variables that we admit a priori that we can&amp;rsquo;t identify in our definition of an IV seems self-defeating. It&amp;rsquo;s impossible to think clearly about the IV assumptions in these terms if we don&amp;rsquo;t know the set of all exposure-outcome confounders. The second drawback is that it&amp;rsquo;s harder to depict graphically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second set of assumption makes no reference to exposure-outcome confounders which means that the assumptions are in terms that we can think more clearly about: basically our instrument can only cause the outcome through the exposure and it can&amp;rsquo;t be confounded with the outcome. And the can be depicted graphically more easily:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;unnamed-chunk-3-1.png&#34; style=&#34;display: block; margin: auto;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another note is that not everyone uses &amp;lsquo;exclusion restriction&amp;rsquo; to mean the same thing. Assumption 1b.is saying something both about the non-existence of direct effects of $IV$ on $Y$ but also about independence (conditional on $A$ and $C$). It&amp;rsquo;s a mix of assumptions 2b. and 2c. from the second set. Assumption 2b. says the exclusion restriction is only about direct effects of $IV$ on $Y$. Note that Assumption 1c. has to be included in the first set to, in some sense, complete the independence assumption in 1b. to include the variables in $C$. In my view, this is another reason to prefer the second set because it keeps the ideas of direct effects and confounding separate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All this to say that there are multiple valid versions of the IV assumptions. When working with one set, it&amp;rsquo;s important to not confuse it with another set.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Author soup: measurement error in authorship</title>
      <link>/post/author-soup/2019-07-25-authorship/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 25 Jul 2019 21:13:14 -0500</pubDate>
      <guid>/post/author-soup/2019-07-25-authorship/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;We worry so much about measurement in epidemiology. (Or at least we should.) We teach about the bias and lack of precision that can occur due to measurement error. We ask participants in our studies to be as accurate as possible when filling out questionnaires to avoid measurement error to the extent possible. So where does this concern about measurement go when it comes to authorship?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most fields have come up with ways of indirectly communicating to the reader the relative contribution of each author. In epidemiology, the first author is the lead author of the paper, the last author is the senior author (although this can mean different things) and sometimes the second author or second to last author can have some additional prestige (depends on who you talk to). Everyone else is just in the middle author soup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why don&amp;rsquo;t we make clearer what each authors&amp;rsquo; contributions are? There are a whole host of ways you can contribute to a paper. &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.casrai.org/credit.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;CRediT (Contributor Roles Taxonomy)&lt;/a&gt; identifies 14 and there are likely many more. There are many roles on that list such as data curation, funding acquisition and reviewing and editing, that, by themselves do not qualify for authorship but are nonetheless important roles. Understandably, we want to compensate people who fulfill these important roles and the only way we have to do so is authorship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imagine if, instead, we could directly acknowledge how each author contributed. It would give so much additional information for people who need to evaluate researchers. If someone has a lot of publications because they created a popular dataset (a crucially important part of research) they would be recognized for their extraordinary contribution to data generation rather than just being a middle author. The same for people who perform critical review of a manuscript towards the end of the project. The more eyes that see a manuscript, the better and we should recognize directly the service they have performed rather than mix them up in the middle author soup with people who maybe contributed data or performed analyses or any other of a whole range of roles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We should also think about the consequences of this information not being generally available. It&amp;rsquo;s possible that everyone benefits and is hurt equally by this authorship measurement error but it&amp;rsquo;s also possible that some people benefit while are people are more hurt by it. I suspect the latter is more likely true and I&amp;rsquo;m not sure it would even be easy to identify who is benefitting or who is being hurt. Making the roles of authors clear will eliminate this inequity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some have mentioned that it&amp;rsquo;s not comfortable to have these conversations with co-authors because it&amp;rsquo;s hard to agree what everyone contributed. I agree. But we ask participants in our studies to answer sensitive questions all the time and so I think it&amp;rsquo;s only fair that we be prepared to experiences a little discomfort ourselves if it leads to better science.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t think this will solve all our problems. People will still be listed as having contributed to a category they didn&amp;rsquo;t contribute to or listed as a manuscript reviewer when they only gave the manuscript a cursory look. But I think it would be a step in the right direction. And I believe that thinking about this as a measurement error issue is the right way to think about this. Giving the people who evaluate us more information about what our contributions are will help eliminate at least a small part of this measurement error.&lt;/p&gt;
