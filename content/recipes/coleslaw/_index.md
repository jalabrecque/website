[Recipe](https://breaddad.com/easy-banana-bread-recipe/)


Ingredients

- 1 small cabbage shredded and chopped (about 6 cups)
- 1 large carrot shredded
- 1 cup mayonnaise
- ⅓ cup granulated sugar
- 2 tablespoon apple cider vinegar
- 1 ½ teaspoon lemon juice fresh lemon juice
- 1 teaspoon salt more or less to taste
- ⅛ teaspoon pepper more or less to taste




Instructions
 
1. Cut the cabbage in half and remove the core from each side.

2. Using a sharp knife cut the cabbage in very thin slices, then chop the slices into small pieces. Place the prepared cabbage in a large mixing bowl.

You can use a food processor to slice or shred the cabbage, or you can also use a box grater to shred the cabbage and carrot.

Personally, I prefer the box grater method but my wife doesn't like it that fine.

3. In a medium bowl, combine mayonnaise, sugar, vinegar, lemon juice, salt, and pepper. Mix until smooth and creamy.

4. Pour the slaw dressing over the cabbage and carrots. Thoroughly mix to combine. Refrigerate until ready to serve.
Cole slaw is always better after sitting for a day, make sure to mix the slaw a few times as it sits in the fridge.
