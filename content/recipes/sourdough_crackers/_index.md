## Ingredients

- 1 cup (113g) King Arthur White Whole Wheat Flour
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1 cup (227g) sourdough starter, unfed/discard
- 4 tablespoons (57g) unsalted butter, room temperature
- oil, for brushing
- coarse salt (such as kosher or sea salt) for sprinkling on top




### Instructions
 
Mix together the flour, salt, sourdough starter, butter, and any optional add-ins (see ideas under "Make them your own" below). Stir to make a smooth (not sticky), cohesive dough.

One tip: try mixing the flour, salt, and butter first, before adding the starter. Butter coats the flour with fat, which translates to a more tender cracker. This is also a great recipe for your food processor. First process the flour, salt, and butter into an evenly sandy mixture, then add the starter and process just long enough for the dough to come together. Super simple!

A bench knife is a handy tool for dividing the soft dough and scraping it into shape.
Divide the dough in half and shape each half into a small rectangular slab. (I find it easier to roll and handle smaller pieces of dough, so I divide the dough into four pieces rather than two.) Cover with plastic wrap, and refrigerate for 30 minutes, or up to a couple of hours, until the dough is firm.

Preheat the oven to 350°F.

Very lightly flour a piece of parchment large enough to fit a half sheet pan or other large baking sheet. Flour your rolling pin and the top of the dough as well.

Quick tip: A couple of wide rubber bands looped atop one another at each end of your rolling pin creates just about 1/16” clearance between pin and rolling surface: the perfect solution for rolling the dough completely flat and thin, with no bumps or thick edges. Just be aware that you need to keep the width of the dough less than the distance between each set of rubber bands.

Working with one piece at a time, roll the dough about 1/16" thick on the parchment paper. The dough may have ragged, uneven edges; that's OK.  

What happens if you roll your dough 1/8” thick instead of 1/16”? No worries. Thinner dough (1/16") will give you snapping-crisp crackers: think Wheat Thins. Dough rolled 1/8” thick will give you sturdier but still crunchy crackers: think Stoned Wheat Thins.

Lightly spray or brush the dough with oil and sprinkle with salt, or the seasoning of your choice.  

Cut the dough into 1 1/4" squares; a rolling pizza wheel works well here. Don’t separate the squares; they’ll separate themselves as they bake.

If little squares don't excite you, it's fine to experiment with different sizes and shapes of crackers. Cut triangles, rectangles, or diamonds, and make them any size you like. Since there will be less heat-absorbing edge exposed on larger crackers, though, you may have to bake them a bit longer.

Prick ("dock") each square with the tines of a fork, if desired. This will keep the crackers flat; if you don’t mind a few of them puffing into little “pitas” as they bake, go ahead and skip the pricking.

Transfer the crackers and parchment together onto a baking sheet.  

Bake the crackers for 20 to 25 minutes, reversing the baking sheets (top to bottom, front to back) midway through. The crackers should be very lightly browned, with those around the edges a deeper brown. Thicker crackers should be baked 30 to 35 minutes in order to dry out fully.

Remove the crackers from the oven, and transfer them to a cooling rack. Store airtight at room temperature for up to a week; freeze for longer storage.
