Ingredients

- 1 pound beef stew meat, cut into 1-2 inch pieces
- 2 tablespoon all-purpose flour
- 2 tablespoon unsalted butter
- 2 cup beef broth or beef stock
- 5 large red potatoes
- 1 medium yellow onion, diced
- 1 cup carrots, chopped
- 2 cloves of garlic, minced
- 1 tablespoon soy sauce
- 2 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
- 2 tablespoon tomato paste
- salt and pepper to taste




Instructions
 
1. Start with saut√© mode to brown the meat and then add the beef broth. When you pour in the broth, stir around the bottom to deglaze the bottom of the pan and release all those flavorful bits into the broth for the best taste.
2. Add the rest of the ingredients and stir, then pressure cook on stew mode for 35 minutes.
3. Once you lock the lid of the Instant Pot and set the timer you're good to go to forget about this cooking until you are ready to eat.
4. Let the pressure release naturally over the 30-40 minutes after cooking for the best results.
