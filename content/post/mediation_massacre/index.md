title: "How bad do methods have to be for us to take action?"

First, I want to strongly state that my goal here is not to demean the authors here in any way whatsoever. If there were some way to present what they wrote that did not allow people to identify the publication I would do so. I sincerely believe they are motivated to improve our knowledge of human health.

My goal here is to ask the question: Is there are threshold at which methods are so bad that action must be taken?

Here is the paragraph from the paper. The topic is whether neighbourhood level deprivation is a mediator of the effect of ethnicity on deaths due to COVID. 

> **Selected confounders**
>
>Age, measured at 16 March 2020, and sex were included as covariates in this analysis due to lower age and proportion of women in the SAB population within UK Biobank. Additional confounders were not considered due to the mediation model and pathway specified.
>
>Specifically, mediation analyses assume that: (i) there is no exposure-outcome confounding; (ii) there is no mediator-outcome confounding; (iii) there is no exposure-mediator confounding and (iv) no mediator-outcome confounder is itself affected by the exposure. When ethnicity is set as the exposure, assumptions (i) and (iii) hold a priori as only unmeasured historical or genetic factors are true potential confounds of the construct of ethnicity. For assumption (ii), traditional confounders such as health behaviour or chronic disease are implausible confounders of deprivation and may further violate assumption (iv) as both can be argued to be influenced by ethnicity.15,16 Implausibility of confounders for deprivation within the model follows from a hypothesis supported by the literature that inequalities in health or health behaviours in people living with high deprivation are, in the most part, the result of high deprivation itself.17,18 The DAG shown in Supplementary figure S2 illustrates this concept in detail.

I want to reiterate here that I sincerely believe the goal of the authors here is to improve an important societal ethnic inequality. But unfortunately, their motivation does not extend to them learning how to properly use and interpret mediation analyses. 

@. Both ethnicity and deprivation are problematic due to the consistency assumption
@. Not answering the right question.
@. Assumptions i) and (iii) definitely DO NOT hold a priori. If this were true, it would be trivial to study the causal effect of race on anything.
@. If you could ask and answer causal questions about ethnicity, any risk factor for the outcome that are different across ethnicities (without being mediators) would be a confounder. So any variable where there is an ethnic inequality due to historical reasons that is also a risk factor for the outcome would be a confounder here. There are many historical inequalties here to consider.
@. If a variable violates assumption iv it definitely DOES NOT MEAN you should not adjust for it. It means you have to deal with it in a special way.


> **Conclusions**

> The excess risk of COVID-19 outcomes in South Asian and black communities could be substantially reduced with population level policies targeting material deprivation.
