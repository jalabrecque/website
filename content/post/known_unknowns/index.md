Over the past couple of years, I've been listening to the [Mindscape podcast](https://www.preposterousuniverse.com/podcast/) hosted by Sean Carroll. I've learned a lot but what I think about most is the way physicists approach uncertainty. Carroll himself is a theoretical physicist with an interest in what's called the interpretations of quantum mechanics (his recent book [Something Deeply Hidden](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/44065062-something-deeply-hidden) is a great read on this topic ). Long story short, there are many different potential interpretations of quantum mechanics but we don't have the data yet to determine which is true. And physicists like Carroll take a healthy attitude to this. Carroll himself prefers an interpretation called "Many Worlds" but is open to the possibility that one of the other options is the "true" interpretation of quantum mechanics. And on his podcast and in other places encourages physicists with other preferred interpretations to work on those theories. After all, when the data come in, if there are a wider variety of theories, the more likely that one of them will fit the new data better.
