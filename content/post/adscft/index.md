There's this story about a guy, who is always drunk for some reason, who's looking for his wallet under a streetlight. A police officer shows up and offers to help him look but once he's convinced the wallet is nowhere to be found he asks, "Are you sure this is where you lost your wallet?" To which the drunk man replies, "No, I lost it in the part but this is where the light is." (The origin of this story seems to be [Nazreddin looking for a lost ring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasreddin#Nasreddin's_ring).)

It's silly because, though you do need to be able to see to find the wallet, you also need to be in the right place. This drunk guy has foolishly traded off being in the right place for being able to see.
