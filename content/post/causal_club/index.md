This summer here at Erasmus MC, we've had what I've called, through lack of imagination, "Causal Inference Club". All it is is a few people getting together and going over basic principles in causal inference driven by questions from those attending. I thought I'd extend the invitation to anyone who happens across this post and might be interested. We meet every second Friday at 13h Central European Time. The next session will be Aug 19.

 If you are interested, email me at j [dot] labrecque [at] erasmusmc [dot] nl
