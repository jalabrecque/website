- association has to have some connection to causation or else we wouldn't care about it
- we can interpret any association as "just an association" but that is not useful, it's only useful if we can make arguments that it has some connection to a causal effect we're interested in
- If we say "association" we make absolutely no claim to where the causal effect is in relation to the association we found
- We cannot say we found "the causal effect" (assuming we were specific about which one we were interested in) because it relies on untestable assumptions
- The ONLY thing we can do is make arguments regarding how the association we found is related to a causal effect. We can never make arguments about the precise nature of the bias otherwise we can just correct for it. But we can place limits on the bias, make arguments that certain biases are not large etc.
