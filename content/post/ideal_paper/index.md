I was daydreaming the other day and was thinking about what would be in an ideal, observational study with a causal goal. I'll update this as I think of things:

1. A clear causal question preferably written in counterfactual notation and accompanied by a table outlining the [target trial](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5550532/).      

2.The causal assumptions required to interpret the estimates as causal are clearly written in terms of question at hand. So not, for example, "we assumed exchangeability was satisfied," but instead, "after adjusting for age, sex, blood pressure etc, the BMI of those who did and didn't receive my miracle weight-loss drug would be the same on average if they received the same treatment (conditional exchangeability)." And ideally, whenever an estimate is interpreted as causal there is a reference to the previously mentioned assumptions so it's always clear that the statement about causality is conditional on the assumptions being satisfied. I've tweeted about this kind of stuff before:  <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">E.g.

3. Sensitivity analyses. Show me what happens when your assumptions are violated. Bonus points if you use external knowledge to show me the bias that would result from the most likely violations of the assumptions. 

This is not a complete list by any means. Feel free to contact me on Twitter [@ja_labrecque_](https://twitter.com/ja_labrecque_) or any where else you can get a hold of me if you have suggestions.
