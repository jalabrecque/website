1. Does things the right way either because was taught that way or self-taught
2. Does things the wrong way because they were taught incorrectly and are told incorrect things by editors/reviewers
3. Learned wrong and does things wrong. Assumes they're doing everything right, doesn't not care much
4. Kind of knows they're doing things wrong but as long as they can publish, it's fine
