abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic has introduced a myriad of challenges to the social
  life and care of people with Parkinson's disease (PD), which could potentially worsen
  mental health problems. We used baseline data of the PRIME-NL study (N,=,844) to
  examine whether the association between COVID-19 stressors and mental health is
  disproportionately large in specific subgroups of people with PD and to explore
  effects of hypothetical reductions in COVID-19 stressors on mental health and quality
  of life. The mean (SD) age of the study population was 70.3 (7.8) years and 321
  (38.0%) were women. The linear regression effect estimate of the association of
  COVID-19 stressors with mental health was most pronounced in women, highly educated
  people, people with advanced PD and people prone to distancing or seeking social
  support. Smaller effect estimates were found in people scoring high on confrontive
  coping or planful problem solving. The parametric G-formula method was used to calculate
  the effects of hypothetical interventions on COVID-19 stressors. An intervention
  reducing stressors with 50% in people with above median MDS-UPDRS-II decreased the
  Beck Depression Inventory in this group from 14.7 to 10.6, the State-Trait Anxiety
  Inventory from 81.6 to 73.1 and the Parkinson's Disease Quality of Life Questionnaire
  from 35.0 to 24.3. Insights from this cross-sectional study help to inform tailored
  care interventions to subgroups of people with PD most vulnerable to the impact
  of COVID-19 on mental health and quality of life.
