abstract: 'OBJECTIVE: Administrative data are increasingly being used for research
  and surveillance about rheumatic diseases. However, literature reviews have revealed
  a lack of consistency in methods for conducting observational rheumatic disease
  studies, a situation that can lead to findings that cannot be compared. Our purpose
  was to develop best-practice consensus statements about the use of administrative
  data for rheumatic disease research and surveillance in Canada. n nMETHODS: We convened
  52 decision makers, epidemiologists, clinicians, and researchers to a 2-day workshop.
  Prior to this, participants formed working groups to examine 3 best-practice categories:
  case definitions, epidemiology methods, and comorbidity and outcomes measurement.
  The groups conducted systematic or scoping reviews on key topics. At the workshop,
  evidence from the reviews was presented and consensus-building techniques were used
  to develop the best-practice statements. The statements were presented, discussed,
  revised (as needed), and then subjected to voting. n nRESULTS: Thirteen best-practice
  consensus statements were developed and endorsed by consensus. For the first category,
  these consensus statements addressed validation techniques for rheumatic disease
  case definitions and case ascertainment bias. The consensus statements for epidemiology
  methods focused on confounding and drug exposure measurement. For comorbidity and
  outcomes measurement, consensus statements were developed for multiple conditions,
  including osteoporosis and fragility fractures, cancer, infections, cardiovascular
  disease, and renal disease. Strengths and limitations of administrative data were
  identified in relation to each topic. n nCONCLUSION: Our best-practice consensus
  statements are consistent with other recent guidelines, including those for rheumatic
  disease biologics registries, but address additional issues specific to administrative
  data. Continuing work focuses on disseminating these consensus statements to multiple
  audiences.'
