abstract: 'OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the quality of the methods and reporting of published
  studies that validate administrative database algorithms for rheumatic disease case
  ascertainment. METHODS: We systematically searched MEDLINE, Embase, and the reference
  lists of articles published from 1980 to 2011. We included studies that validated
  administrative data algorithms for rheumatic disease case ascertainment using medical
  record or patient-reported diagnoses as the reference standard. Each study was evaluated
  using published standards for the reporting and quality assessment of diagnostic
  accuracy, which informed the development of a methodologic framework to help critically
  appraise and guide research in this area. RESULTS: Twenty-three studies met the
  inclusion criteria. Administrative database algorithms to identify cases were most
  frequently validated against diagnoses in medical records (83%). Almost two-thirds
  of the studies (61%) used diagnosis codes in administrative data to identify potential
  cases and then reviewed medical records to confirm the diagnoses. The remaining
  studies did the reverse, identifying patients using a reference standard and then
  testing algorithms to identify cases in administrative data. Many authors (61%)
  described the patient population, but few (26%) reported key measures of diagnostic
  accuracy (sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values).
  Only one-third of studies reported disease prevalence in the validation study sample.
  CONCLUSION: The methods used in administrative data validation studies of rheumatic
  diseases are highly variable. Few studies reported key measures of diagnostic accuracy
  despite their importance for drawing conclusions about the validity of administrative
  database algorithms. We developed a methodologic framework and recommendations for
  validation study conduct and reporting.'
