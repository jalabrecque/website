abstract: "Objective: To determine cancer incidence in a large clinical juvenile-onset\
  \ arthritis population. Methods: We combined data from 6 existing North American\
  \ juvenile-onset arthritis cohorts. Patients with juvenile-onset arthritis were\
  \ linked to regional cancer registries to detect incident cancers after cohort entry,\
  \ defined as first date seen in the paediatric rheumatology clinic. The expected\
  \ number of malignancies was obtained by multiplying the person- years observed\
  \ (defined from cohort entry to end of follow-up) by the geographically matched\
  \ age, sex and calendar year-specific cancer rates. The standardised incidence ratios\
  \ (SIR; ratio of cancers observed to expected) were generated, with 95% CIs. Results:\
  \ The 6 juvenile arthritis registries provided a total of 5294 patients. The mean\
  \ age at cohort entry was 8.9 (SD 5.0) years and 68% of participants were female.\
  \ The mean duration of follow-up was 6.8 years with a total of 36 063 person-years\
  \ spanning 1978– 2012. During follow-up, 9 invasive cancers occurred, compared with\
  \ 10.9 expected (SIR 0.82, 95% CI 0.38 to 1.5). 3 of these were haematological (Hodgkin's,\
  \ non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and leukaemia). 6 of the patients with cancer were exposed\
  \ to disease- modifying drugs; 5 of these had also been exposed to biological agents.\
  \ Conclusions: We did not clearly demonstrate an increase in overall malignancy\
  \ risk in patients with juvenile-onset arthritis followed for an average of almost\
  \ 7 years. 3 of the 9 observed cancers were haematological. 5 of the cancers arose\
  \ in children exposed to biological agents. Longer follow-up of this population\
  \ is warranted, with further study of drug effects. What is already known about\
  \ this subject? $▴right$ In many systemic autoimmune rheumatic dis- eases, including\
  \ rheumatoid arthritis, there is an increased risk (compared to the general popula-\
  \ tion) of certain malignancies. What does this study add? $▴right$ This study provides\
  \ a multi-centre perspective of the issue of cancer risk in juvenile arthritis,\
  \ in clinic-based settings. How might this impact on clinical practice? $▴right$\
  \ In juvenile-onset arthritis, cancer was a relatively rare event, which is reassuring\
  \ for patients and physicians. However, the possibility of an increased risk of\
  \ hematological malignancies in juvenile-onset arthritis remains a concern. This\
  \ and the effects of drug exposures, should be the focus of future studies."
