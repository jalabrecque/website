abstract: Little is known about how rheumatoid arthritis (RA) affects an nindividual's
  ability to relocate. The current literature suggests the nrelationship between health
  and migration is often disease-specific. We nsought to estimate the impact of RA
  diagnosis on migration within a nCanadian province, comparing migration rates in
  residents before and nafter RA diagnosis. We identified a cohort of 81,181 individuals
  ndiagnosed with RA between 1998 and 2009 using Quebec administrative ndatabases.
  A migration was defined as a change in the first three ncharacters of the postal
  code. We categorized migrations as urban or nrural depending upon an individual's
  origin and destination. We nestimated the association between RA diagnosis and migration
  by fitting nmarginal models using a generalized estimating equations approach, nadjusting
  for age, sex, and population level socioeconomic status nindicators. The vast majority
  of moves after RA diagnosis were within nurban areas. RA diagnosis was associated
  with increased migration except nfor people around age 50 moving within urban areas.
  Although RA was nassociated with increased inter-urban migration in many demographic
  ngroups, the net result did not translate to higher rates of nrural-to-urban migration
  after RA diagnosis. Our results suggest fairly ncomplex associations between RA
  diagnosis and migration. Both age and nlocation (urban or rural) modify this effect.
  Overall, we did not see a ngreater movement from rural-to-urban areas after RA diagnosis.
  This is nof interest for studies of regional environmental effects on chronic ndisease
  patterns.
