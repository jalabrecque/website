abstract: "OBJECTIVE: To present preliminary data on incidence of malignancy in juvenile\
  \ idiopathic arthritis (JIA), compared to general population rates. METHODS: We\
  \ examined cancer occurrence within JIA registries at 3 Canadian pediatric rheumatology\
  \ centers. The subjects in the clinic registries were linked to regional tumor registries\
  \ to determine the occurrence of invasive cancers over the observation period (spanning\
  \ 1974-2006). The total number of cancers expected was determined by multiplying\
  \ the person-years in the cohort by age, sex, and calendar year-specific cancer\
  \ rates. The standardized incidence ratio (SIR, ratio of cancers observed to expected)\
  \ was generated, with 95% confidence intervals. RESULTS: The study sample consisted\
  \ of 1834 patients. The female proportion was 67.6%; average age at entry to cohort\
  \ was 8.6 years (SD 5.1). The majority were Caucasian. Subjects contributed 22,341\
  \ patient-years (average 12.2, SD 7.8). Within this observation period, one invasive\
  \ cancer occurred, compared to 7.9 expected (SIR 0.12, 95% CI 0.0, 0.70). This was\
  \ a hematological cancer (Hodgkin's lymphoma), representing a SIR for hematological\
  \ malignancies of 0.76 (95% CI 0.02, 4.21). CONCLUSION: Only one invasive cancer\
  \ was identified in this large sample of individuals with JIA, observed for an average\
  \ of 12.2 years each. These data suggest that, at least in the initial years following\
  \ diagnosis of JIA, the  risk of invasive cancers overall is not markedly increased.\
  \ The results do not rule out the possibility of a baseline increased risk of hematological\
  \ malignancies."
