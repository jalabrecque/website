abstract: 'OBJECTIVES: The authors aim to calculate the number of live births, before
  and after systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) diagnosis, in women diagnosed during
  their reproductive years and to compare this with general population rates. METHODS:
  The authors identified women with SLE using Quebec administrative databases (1 January
  1994 to 31 December 2003). The authors determined the number of live births, and
  calculated the standardised incidence ratio (SIR) of observed to expected live births.
  RESULTS: 1334 women with SLE were identified. Overall, the number of live births
  over the interval (559) was below that which would be expected (708) (SIR 0.79;
  95% CI 0.73 to 0.86). Compared with the general population, live births were substantially
  lower after SLE diagnosis (SIR 0.62; 95% CI 0.55 to 0.70) than before diagnosis
  (SIR 1.01; 95% CI 0.90 to 1.13). CONCLUSION: After diagnosis, women with SLE have
  substantially fewer live births than the general population.'
