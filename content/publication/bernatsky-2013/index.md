abstract: "INTRODUCTION: The aim of this study was to assess cancer incidence in childhood-onset\
  \ systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). n nMETHODS: We ascertained cancers within\
  \ SLE registries at 10 pediatric centers. Subjects were linked to cancer registries\
  \ for the observational interval, spanning 1974 to 2009. The ratio of observed to\
  \ expected cancers represents the standardized incidence ratio (SIR) or relative\
  \ cancer risk in childhood-onset SLE, versus the general population. n nRESULTS:\
  \ There were 1020 patients aged $<$18 at cohort entry. Most (82%) were female and\
  \ Caucasian; mean age at cohort entry was 12.6 years (standard deviation (SD),=,3.6).\
  \ Subjects were observed for a total of 7,986 (average 7.8) patient-years. Within\
  \ this interval, only three invasive cancers were expected. However, 14 invasive\
  \ cancers occurred with an SIR of 4.7, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.6 to 7.8.\
  \ Three hematologic cancers were found (two non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, one leukemia),\
  \ for an SIR of 5.2 (95% CI 1.1 to 15.2). The SIRs stratified by age group and sex,\
  \ were similar across these strata. There was a trend for highest cancer occurrence\
  \ 10 to 19 years after SLE diagnosis. n nCONCLUSIONS: These results suggest an increased\
  \ cancer risk in pediatric onset SLE versus the general population. In absolute\
  \ terms, this represents relatively few events. Of note, risk may be highest only\
  \ after patients have transferred to adult care."
