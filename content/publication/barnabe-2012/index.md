abstract: 'OBJECTIVE: To estimate the population-based prevalence of systemic lupus
  erythematosus (SLE) and systemic sclerosis (SSc) in Alberta, Canada, stratified
  by First Nations status. n nMETHODS: Physician billing claims and hospitalization
  data for the province of Alberta (1994-2007) were used to ascertain cases of SLE
  and SSc using 3 case definitions. A latent class Bayesian hierarchical regression
  model was employed to account for the imperfect sensitivity and specificity of billing
  and hospitalization data in case ascertainment. We accounted for demographic factors,
  estimating prevalence rates for the First Nations and non-First Nations populations
  by sex, age group, and location of residence (urban/rural). n nRESULTS: Our model
  estimated the prevalence of SLE in Alberta to be 27.3 cases per 10,000 females (95%
  credible interval [95% CrI] 25.9-28.8) and 3.2 cases per 10,000 males (95% CrI 2.6-3.8).
  The overall prevalence of SSc in Alberta was 5.8 cases per 10,000 females (95% CrI
  5.1-6.5) and 1.0 case per 10,000 males (95% CrI 0.7-1.4). First Nations females
  over 45 years of age had twice the prevalence of either SLE or SSc relative to non-First
  Nations females. There was also a trend toward higher overall SLE prevalence in
  urban dwellers, and higher overall SSc prevalence in rural residents. n nCONCLUSION:
  First Nations females older than 45 years of age have an increased prevalence of
  either SLE or SSc. This may reflect a true predominance of autoimmune rheumatic
  diseases in this demographic, or may indicate systematic differences in health care
  delivery.'
