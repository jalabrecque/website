abstract: Supplemental digital content is available in the text., Our findings show
  that non-Dutch background, lower maternal education, and lower net household income
  level may be new risk factors for myopia development in the Netherlands. Newly introduced
  physical activity spaces may not be effective enough in increasing outdoor exposure
  in children to reduce eye growth.
