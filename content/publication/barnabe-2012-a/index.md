abstract: "OBJECTIVE: To estimate the population-based prevalence of autoimmune inflammatory\
  \ myopathy (AIM) in Alberta, Canada, with a specific focus on rates in the First\
  \ Nations population. n nMETHODS: Physician billing claims and hospitalization data\
  \ for the province of Alberta (1994-2007) were used to estimate the probability\
  \ of having AIM (i.e., polymyositis or dermatomyositis) based on 3 case definitions.\
  \ A latent class Bayesian hierarchical regression model was employed to account\
  \ for the imperfect sensitivity and specificity of billing and hospitalization data\
  \ in case ascertainment. We accounted for demographic factors of sex, age group,\
  \ and location of residence (urban or rural) in estimating the prevalence rates\
  \ within the First Nations and non-First Nations populations. n nRESULTS: The overall\
  \ prevalence of AIM was 25.0 per 100,000 persons (95% credible interval [95% CrI]\
  \ 13.4-49.0) in the First Nations population and 33.8 (95% CrI 28.9-39.6) in the\
  \ non-First Nations population. For both groups, prevalence was increased in women\
  \ relative to men, rural women relative to urban women, and in those age $>$45 years.\
  \ n nCONCLUSION: Unlike other rheumatic diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, systemic\
  \ lupus erythematosus, and systemic sclerosis, we did not detect an increased prevalence\
  \ of AIM in Alberta's First Nations population relative to the non-First Nations\
  \ population. Potential limitations include coding errors, underidentification of\
  \ First Nations members, and recognized differences in access to care for the First\
  \ Nations population."
