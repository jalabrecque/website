## Leaving Rotterdam

Our plan was to drive through five countries on our first day: the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, France and Germany. But Luxembourg is so small that I missed one turn and that made us literally miss all of Luxembourg. Luckily we caught it on the way back. We stayed one night in a cool inn/hotel with creaky floors but an amazing view.
