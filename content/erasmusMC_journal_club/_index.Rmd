## The idea behind journal club

I just wanted to take a few minutes to write down a bit about the philosophy behind journal club. The main idea behind the journal club in our department is to have a place to discuss ideas, whether new or old, in an atmosphere that is open and inclusive. A place where anyone can participate, there are no wrong or stupid questions, and we move together as a group to better understand the topic of discussion.

I also want to add that there is also benefit to attending even if you don't fully understand the topic or speak during the meeting. I encountered many epi concepts for the first time in a journal club and, while I might have left with only a vague understanding, when I did re-encounter the concept later in the classroom, I was already familiar with it making it easier to learn. So I encourage attendance even just to observe the conversation.

It's also a great place to sharpen your "thinking on your feet" and scientific creativity skills. The conversations in journal club don't tend to be always go where we expect them to and I love hearing new ideas or new perspectives on old ideas and I don't know where I would encounter those ideas otherwise!

Lastly, journal club can expose you to new topics. I discovered the topic, method and datas et that I used in PhD at the social epidemiology journal club at McGill (in different sessions) so you never know what you're going to come away with when you attend. 

Let me know if you have any ideas for the journal club. Looking forward to future meetings!
