A food hall/brewery, it's a great place to have a bite to ear and have a beer. It's right on the water too so you get a view of the city. The beer selection is fantastic and there's a wide variety of delicious food to choose from. We have spent a lot of time at Fenix and it's one of the places we like most in Rotterdam.

Winkel means store in Dutch so you can't drink here. But it has a great beer selection and a super nice owner who can lead you what you're looking for. This is exclusively where I buy beer in Rotterdam.
