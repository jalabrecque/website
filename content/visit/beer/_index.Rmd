A food hall/brewery, it's a great place to have a bite to ear and have a beer. It's right on the water too so you get a view of the city. The beer selection is fantastic and there's a wide variety of delicious food to choose from. We have spent a lot of time at Fenix and it's one of the places we like most in Rotterdam.

Winkel means store in Dutch so you can't drink here. But it has a great beer selection and a super nice owner who can lead you what you're looking for. This is exclusively where I buy beer in Rotterdam.

Really great selection of beers. Great snacks and food. A little fancy but not too expensive.

Built into the underpass of an old raised train track. Great selection of beer and in a cool neighbourhood.

Indoor bocce ball courts (p√©tanque), kareoke room, board games, mini food hall. A great place to spend a couple hours having some beers and having fun.
