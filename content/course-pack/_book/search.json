Descriptive questions are basically describing the state of the world now or in the past. It might be easiest to list some examples:\n\nWhat is the incidence of diabetes in Finland?\nWhat is the prevalence of diabetes in Sweden?\nWhat is the the geographic distribution of measles cases in the Canadian provine of Alberta?\nHow is the number of broken teeth among hockey players changing over time?\nDo people earning a minimum wage salary do less exercise than people earning more than minimum wage?\n\nThese are questions about the prevalence or incidence of disease or its spatial distribution. Or about about how common certain health behaviours are. Or how patterns change over time. Or comparing these descriptive values between groups.\nDescriptive questions will mostly look very simple:\n\\[ \\Pr[\\textrm{Diabetes}_{t=1}|\\textrm{Diabetes}_{t=0}=0] \\]\nThis can read as the probability of getting diabetes at time 1 among people who did not have diabetes at time 0. If we wanted to just know the prevalence we could write:\n\\[ \\Pr[\\textrm{Diabetes}_{t=1}] \\] This is the probability of having diabetes at time 1 among everyone.\nExamples of descriptive questions:\n\nWhat is the incidence of diabetes in the Netherlands?\nIs the incidence of diabetes in the Netherlands increasing with time?"

Some of the reasons for doing this come from motivations that are intended to improve the science. I have been having these conversations for years now putting forth my arguments for why it really makes no sense pretend we’re not trying to answer a causal answer and I have received objections, but no answer to my arguments. In the next sections I’ll go through some of these arguments. If you think you have an argument for using the word association in your research question, I’d love to hear it!\n\n“The” association\nArticles often claim that their research question is wanting to know “the” association between an exposure and outcome. I have asked people which association they are talking about when they say “the” association. No one has been able to answer me yet (unless they admit that it’s just a euphemism for a causal effect). In this paper you can see argument for why, if your underlying question is causal, it is actually impossible to frame your question as an association.\n\n\n3.4.1 But we never know whether our answer really is causal\nIn your daily life, do you feel you can only ask a question when you’re guaranteed to get a correct answer? Is it okay to ask someone, “is it going to rain today?” if we’re unsure they’ll accurately report to us the precipitation forecast? To some, this is how we should approach causal questions. Unless you can guarantee that the answer will be unbiased, you’re not allowed to ask the question. Dude, this is science, we’re constantly asking questions that we don’t know the answer to and that our study will not give a definitive answer of.\nWe also don’t require this when people are trying to answer descriptive or predictive models. It’s known that many prediction models are either not validated or are found to be terrible. But we don’t tell people they should rephrase their question without the word prediction. Or if someone wants to know the incidence of diabetes, they can only guarantee their estimate is unbiased if it comes from a random sample of their target population. But many descriptive studies are not from random samples and we allow them nonetheless to go around saying they’re trying to answer a descriptive question!\n\n\n3.4.2 Association for everything\nIn research, it’s crucially important to be able to distinguish your question from your answer. If you use the word association for your question and for your answer, you’re making the lines between question and answer blurry. You saw for causal questions that we have a causal estimand which we cannot know the answer to perfectly. Later you will see what role the word association plays in causal inference. Briefly, it’s just a stepping stone between your research question and the interpretation of your results. In other words, causal inference has a clear role for associations whereas it is common in epidemiology to just see it used for everything.\n\n\n3.4.3 Biased away from what?\n\n\n3.4.4 Research questions that tell us nothing\nIf a research question says something like, “Our objective is to estimate the association between education and colorectal cancer.” It is not possible to tell whether the question is descriptive or causal. As we saw earlier and as we’ll see throughout this book, the methods you use to answer descriptive and causal questions are vastly different. But this research question cannot tell us whether the article is going to be about a descriptive question where we compare colorectal incidence between education group or whether it’s going to be a causal study where we trying to control for confounding to isolate the causal effect of education on colorectal incidence. What good is a research question if it tells us almost nothing regarding what the study will be about.\n\n\n3.4.5 Do “associational” research questions exist?\nIf an associational research question is a legitimate type of research question distinct from descriptive, predictive and causal, what methods should we use to answer it? If it’s a distinct question, it must use methods that are different. If it used exactly the same methods, how could it be a different question?\nBut there are no courses on “associational inference” that parallel “causal inference” courses. There is no one out there doing target association emulation."

    "text": "2.1 Variables\nWe use letters to represent variables. For example, in causal inference, we often use an \\(A\\) to indicate the exposure1 and a \\(Y\\) for the outcome. But these are just conventions. You are free to use whichever letter you’d like. You can use \\(Y\\) for exposure and \\(A\\) for the outcome if you want. There are no rules. Well, maybe one rule that you should always be clear about what a variable means.1 The reason why \\(A\\) is commonly used is because a lot of James Robins’ work on causal inference in the 1980’s focused on antiretroviral therapy as the treatment.\nUppercase letters used to indicate a random variable.2 A random variable can be thought of as the product of a stochastic process. In contrast,lowercase letters indicate a specific value of that variable. So \\(A\\) might represent a binary variable with \\(0\\)’s representing untreated participants and \\(1\\)’s representing treated participants. Lowercase \\(a\\) can then take the value \\(0\\) or \\(1\\). For example, if I write \\(a=1\\) I’m referring to treatment and if I write \\(a=0\\) I’m referring to the untreated condition. Sometimes we’ll use \\(A=a=1\\) (or \\(A=1\\) for short) to refer to treated people. Or sometimes we’ll use \\(a=1\\) to indicate that we want to set a person’s or a group of people’s treatment to \\(1\\). If this is feeling quite abstract at this point, it’ll become clearer as you get through this chapter and, hopefully, even clearer when you start seeing how they’re applied.2 See this Khan Academy video for a more in depth explanation of random variables."

Put simply, he argued that you can’t prove things in science, you can only disprove them. So essentially, we should always 1 be trying to do the strongest possible test to prove our hypothesis wrong. In other words, to reject the null hypothesis. But others came along and pointed out that when you’re testing the null hypothesis, you’re not actually testing only the null hypothesis because your analysis relies on many other auxiliary hypotheses. In causal inference, the causal assumptions (like the assumption of no uncontrolled confounding) are auxiliary hypotheses and we know that those assumptions are never satisfied (the best we can do is convince ourselves that they’re close enough to satisfied). So if you tell me that your statistical test is testing both your main null hypothesis that the exposure has no effect on the outcome and auxiliary hypotheses, including no uncontrolled confounding, I learn nothing from this test because I already don’t believe your auxiliary hypothesis.1 Dutch psychologist Daniel Lakens has an excellent, free book about statistical inference that includes some background on the philosophy. I disagree with his view on hypothesis testing in general in part, I think, because our fields of research are very different (though agree with him on other things), but I still think he’s worth reading.\nYou might say"
