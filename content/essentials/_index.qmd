# Day 2

## Morning (9am-12:30pm): The crucial difference between associations and causation


- 9-10: What is an association? Is it a good research question?
  - [Let's look at the word association in the wild.](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeCroltgJ04wRpkZnw3-KeC0q2TDLk9HQqprr3kz36HF72oGQ/viewform?pli=1)
  - What is an association?
- 10-11: Causal inference
  - Gaining intuition for causal questions
  - 



Important points

-   We use the word association in research questions for historical reasons, not for good reasons.
-   It is not clear which association is 'the' association when people ask the question: "what is the association between X and Y". And, in fact, there's no way to be clear about which association is 'the' association.
-   There are 3 types of questions in health research:
    -   Descriptive: what is the state of the world?
    -   Predictive: can I take a guess at something I don't know using data?
    -   Causal: how would the world change if I intervened on it?

## Afternoon: How to know what to adjust for

Important points:

-   Directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) have two components:
    -   Variables: these are nodes that represent the variables related to your causal research question
    -   Arrows: these demonstrate the flow of causation from one variable to another (sometimes also called edges)
-   Directed acyclic graphs :
    -   **Directed**: the arrows must have only one arrow head. Undirected arrows don't give us the information we need and double-headed arrows violate the laws of physics
    -   **Acyclic**: there cannot be cycles in the DAG. In other words, there can be place on the graph where you can start at one variable, follow a path along the direction of the arrows, and arrive back at the same variable.
    -   **Graph**: DAGs use graph theory. But fortunately, by learning the simple rules, you don't have to.
